# themattbook.github.io

New portfolio done up in Tailwindcss.

## Objective

Building a more robust and sensical portfolio website using Tailwindcss.

## Tools

The original portfolio was built as a Vue app, but I don't really feel like that's needed at this point in time. A static page for my github.io profile should suffice for now until I can think of more appropriate (not filler) content to serve prospecting visitors.
